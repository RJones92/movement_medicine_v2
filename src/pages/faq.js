            What to expect from your first session
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            On your first visit, we ask you to arrive a few minutes early to
            read and complete some consent forms. We will then have a discussion
            about your problem and your goals, followed by a thorough assessment
            to find out the reason / cause of your problem. We will then be able
            to start the correct treatment. We will always give some advice for
            you to follow at home, so you can continue your recovery away from the
            clinic as well.

            <p>
              An Osteopath is a skilled practitioner in physical therapy, which
              encompasses a wide range of treatment techniques, see list below.
              Your practitioner will suggest and be guided by your preference as
              the right techniques and modalities which will be used within the
              session.

          <Accordion.Header>What should I wear?</Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            Please wear something comfortable and relatively loose fitting. We
            will likely need to see the area which is giving you problems, and
            any active testing which we may ask you to do will be easier in
            freely moving clothing.

          <Accordion.Header>Is treatment safe for me?</Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            Following a thorough assessment and discussion about your medical
            history, we can advise if you should avoid a particular treatment
            modality. However, most forms of manual therapy are relatively safe.
            If you have a particular concern please contact us before booking
            and we can discuss the safety over the telephone.
